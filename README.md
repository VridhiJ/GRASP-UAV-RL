# WindAwareUAV-RL
This repository showcases the modifications I made to [Rotorpy](https://github.com/spencerfolk/rotorpy). All files included originate from the original Rotorpy repository, but this is not the complete Rotorpy framework. This repository is intended to highlight the changes I implemented for my research at GRASP Lab.
